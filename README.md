# Automated Kubernetes Deployment of a ToDoList App

This project sets up a complete on-premises Kubernetes cluster, to automatically deploy a full-stack ToDoList application.

It demonstrates how to manage the entire lifecycle of a microservices-based application using modern DevOps tools like Ansible, Helm, and ArgoCD, from infrastructure provisioning to GitOps-based application deployment.

The ToDoList app used in this project was originally developed by me [here](https://github.com/Thybaau/todolist-app), and has been fully containerized and adapted for Kubernetes.

## Functionalities

This project demonstrates how to:

#### üõ†Ô∏è Using Ansible:

- Provision a kubeadm Kubernetes cluster from scratch.

- Install Helm and Helmfile.

- Install and configure ArgoCD using Helmfile for GitOps-based continuous delivery.

#### üì¶ Using ArgoCD

- Automatically deploy a full-stack ToDoList application (frontend, backend, and PostgreSQL database) using Kubernetes manifests (Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, NetworkPolicies).

- Secure sensitive data with SealedSecrets, enabling safe Git storage for Kubernetes secrets.

- Apply Kubernetes objects like ConfigMaps, Services, and NetworkPolicies to ensure modularity and security.

* Delete task, by clicking on red button to the right of each tasks.
* Edit task, by clicking on the pencil button to the right of each tasks.
* Check/uncheck task with checkbox button. This will validate and cross task.

### Upcoming features

- üèóÔ∏è Configure ArgoCD to handle helmfiles

- üèóÔ∏è Integrate Prometheus and Grafana with ArgoCD and helmfiles for application and cluster monitoring

- üèóÔ∏è Add Loki for centralized log collection and visualization
